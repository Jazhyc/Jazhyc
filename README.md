## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub Profile. I'm Jeremias, an **AI and Video Game enthusiast** studying at the University of Groningen (RUG). Currently, this readme serves as a temporary profile description. Once I learn more markdown, this will change considerably.

I only have a few repositories related to Game Development but I hope to add a large amount of ML and AI ones in the future. Since you're here, you can check out and play the games that I made.
